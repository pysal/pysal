Overall, there were 212 commits that closed 81 issues, together with 14 pull requests since our last release on 2022-02-01.


## Highlights

- The `segregation` package added a new set of measures, the global and local Distortion indices, based on [Bezenac et al](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gean.12271) thanks to an excellent GSoC project by [Noah Bouchier](https://github.com/noahbouchier)
- The `spreg` package added functionalities to estimate endogenous spatial regimes models based on [Anselin & Amaral (2021)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20310.78401)
- A [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03330) highlighting the `spopt` package was published in the Journal of Open Source Software.

# PySAL v2.5.0, 2021-07-31

PySAL 2.5.0 represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test coverage, and improved documentation. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new features (see below) that have been implemented.

Overall, there were 543 commits that closed 190 issues, together with 33 pull requests since our last release on 2021-01-31.


## Package Highlights

### esda
This version merges two large new sets of functionalities:

- map correspondence measures in [`esda.map_comparison`](https://github.com/pysal/esda/blob/master/esda/map_comparison.py)
- shape statistics in [`esda.shape`](https://github.com/pysal/esda/blob/master/esda/shape.py)

### segregation
Version 2.0 of the `segregation` package brings a new API, a massive code restructuring, and dozens of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. For a complete overview of the new API, please see the documentation page at <https://pysal.org/segregation/api>. The new version does away with the distinction between spatial and aspatial segregation indices and instead partitions the functions based on single-group and multi-group measures. The spatial/aspatial distinction is echewed in version 2.0 because *all* aspatial indices can be generalized into spatial versions, following the logic of Reardon and O'Sullivan (see a description in [this example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/knaaptime/segregation/blob/2.0/notebooks/01_singlegroup_indices.ipynb)). Furthermore, "space" can be incorporated into the index calculation using either Euclidean distance or the shortest path along a travel network. With this logic, the package now offers multiscalar segregation profiles for 23 different segregation indices (a first in any software package).

### tobler
Added [pychnophylactic interpolation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1979.10481647).


### spaghetti
 The highlights of this release include functionality to [split network arcs by count](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.Network.html#spaghetti.Network.split_arcs), which compliments the previously available distance splitting, and a [paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02826) in the Journal of Open Source Software. Also, Python 3.6 is no longer supported.


### spopt
This release includes another model to add to the suite: RandomRegions. RandomRegions, originally written by David C. Folch (@dfolch) and Serge Rey, builds regions based on an initial random seed while considering user-defined specifications such as: region count, cardinality, contiguity, and compactness (citation?). Also, we have improved the testing coverage for the models inlcuded in the initial release: AZP, Max-*p*-regions, Region-*k*-means, Skater, Spenc, and WardSpatial.

# PySAL v2.4.0, 2021-01-31
PySAL 2.4.0 represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test
coverage, and improved documentation. Three Google Summer of Code projects made
substantial contributions to this release (see below). All users are encouraged
to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new
features (see below) that have been implemented.

Overall, there were 1155 commits that closed 352 issues, together with 121 pull requests since our last release on 2020-07-29.

## Highlights

### New Package:  [pysal/spopt](https://pysal.org/spopt/)

Provides methods for solving optimization problems with spatial data. Currently, regionalization methods are supported with planned support for facility location and transportation-oriented modeling.

The regionalization models implemented include:
* Max-p-regions: It involves the aggregation or clustering of a set of small areas into the maximum number of homogeneous and spatially contiguous regions such that the value of a regional attribute is higher than a predefined threshold. The number of regions will be endogenized in order to satisfy the threshold. ([Duque, Anselin, and Rey, 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9787.2011.00743.x) and [Wei, Rey, and Knaap, 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2020.1759806?journalCode=tgis20))
* Automatic Zoning Procedure (AZP) algorithm: It can work with any type of objective function that is sensitive to the aggregation of data for a larger number of zones into a pre-specified smaller number of regions ([Openshaw, 1977](https://www.jstor.org/stable/622300?casa_token=QITLwNVUPj4AAAAA%3AKXYVQHrdeAtefxZKkvxxUrWA_QCedSJrZwQD36F16Jfqx7Vq47uu1G_vp9I085Iozy_roZ_Dh6qQopZ6yXjfPsy4Y2aBqso-l0wZS2YqNv9pkh1JNXc&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) 
and [Openshaw and Rao, 1995](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/a270425))
* Region-K-means: It is K-means clustering for regions with the constraint that each cluster forms a spatially connected component.
* Skater: It is a constrained spatial regionalization algorithm based on spanning tree pruning. Specifically, the number of edges is prespecified to be cut in a continuous tree to group spatial units into contiguous regions. ([AssunCao et al., 2006](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658810600665111?casa_token=ovYjEkDDjbAAAAAA%3AjX8FMJWkrJDbSy8nmGiCOUFV6Fl-5KAhDibrQ89qqEpM4HvJ5wyNsrn7_x5qOwLmauKIh-RUdfZm))
* Spenc: spatially-encouraged spectral clustering is an approach to balance spatial and feature coherence using kernel combination in spectral clustering.([Wolf, 2020] (https://osf.io/yzt2p/))
* WardSpatial: It is an Agglomerative Clustering using Ward linkage with a spatial connectivity constraint. Basically, it is a "bottom-up" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are chosen to merge at each step in order to minimize the variance of the clusters. ([sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html))


### Enhancements to existing packages

#### libpysal

Thanks to the Google Summer of Code 2020 led by Mragank Shekhar (@MgeeeeK), we
have built an interface with xarray that allows you to create spatial weights
matrices from xarray.DataArray objects. This means it is possible to build a
weights matrix from raster data. We are using numba and multi-core where
possible so the implementation is performant and scalable within memory limits.
Current weights supported include:

- libpysal.weights.Rook.from_xarray
- libpysal.weights.Queen.from_xarray

In addition, the following methods have been added and are exposed to end users:

- [RECOMMENDED] da2WSP, to build a thin weights matrix (WSP) from a xarray.DataArray da2W, to build a weights matrix from a xarray.DataArray
- [RECOMMENDED] wsp2da, to reconstruct a xarray.DataArray object from a thin weights matrix and a pandas.Series (e.g. with mapclassify or esda.Moran_Local outcomes
- w2da, to reconstruct a xarray.DataArray object from a weights matrix and a pandas.Series (e.g. with mapclassify or esda.Moran_Local outcomes testDataArray, to generate a toy xarray.DataArray object for testing purposes.


#### esda

- Integration of the work of @jeffcsauer's 2020 GSOC project. This adds tons of new statistical estimators, such as:
  - the local heteroskedasticity estimator, `esda.LOSH`
  - local geary and multivariate geary estimators, `esda.Geary_Local` and `esda.Geary_Local_MV`
  - local join counts in univariate, bivariate, and multivariate flavors, `esda.Join_Counts_Local`, `esda.Join_Counts_Local_BV`, and `esda.Join_Counts_Local_MV`. 
- "analytical" moments for Moran's I for replication/comparison to R. Forms are provided in [Sokal 1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1998.tb00406.x). 

#### spreg

Thanks to the Google Summer of Code 2020 led by [paboloestrada](https://github.com/pabloestradac), we have added the following functionality:

- Panel_RE_Lag: random effects panel estimation with spatial lagged dependent variable.
- Panel_RE_Error: random effects panel estimation with spatial error interaction.
- Lagrange Multiplier test: classic and robust version.
- Hausman test.

#### spaghetti
The highlights of this release include a [bug fix](https://github.com/pysal/spaghetti/pull/535) for how network segments were being split (raised in [#526](https://github.com/pysal/spaghetti/issues/526)) and additions to several notebooks ([spatial network segmentation](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/notebooks/network-segmentation.html#Large-synthetic-clusters), [caveats](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/tutorials.html), and [network-constrained spatial autocorrelation](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/notebooks/network-spatial-autocorrelation.html#A-highly-clustered-synthetic-example)). Also, `spaghetti` is now tested against Python 3.9.

#### tobler

- interpolation to hexagons using h3f
- more efficient unary_union in h3f

#### segregation

- segregation measures on network distances

#### mapclassify
- streamlined api

# PySAL 2.3.0, 2020-07-30

PySAL 2.3.0 represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test coverage, and improved documentation. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new features (see below) that have been implemented.

Overall, there were 1343 commits that closed 273 issues, together with 166 pull requests since our last release on 2020-02-09.



## Major Highlights of PySAL 2.3.0



### Entirely New Packages

In this release, the PySAL family has expanded to include:
#### [`pysal/access`](https://pysal.org/esda)
Providing  **classical and novel measures of spatial accessibility to services**.

- We implement classic [spatial access models](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/access.access.html#access.access), allowing easy comparison of methodologies and assumptions.
- We support spatial access research by providing pre-computed [travel time matrices](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html) and share code for computing new matrices at scale.
- We also developed a simple [web app](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/app.html) that runs the package on Amazon Web Services, allowing users to explore results without installing the package.  We think this is a fun new strategy for trying new analysis methods, and hope that it will make the package more accessible to professionals.


This access models implemented  include:

- Floating Catchment Areas (FCA): For each provider, this is the ratio of providers to clients within a given travel time to the provider ([Huff 1963](https://doi.org/10.2307/3144521), [Joseph and Bantock 1982](https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(82)90428-), and [Luo 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1353-8292(02)00067-9)).
- Two-Stage FCAs (2SFCA): Calculated in two steps for a given travel time to the provider: 1) for each provider, the provider-to-client ratio is generated, 2) for each point of origin, these ratios are then summed ([Luo and Wang 2002](https://doi.org/10.1068/b29120), and [Wang and Luo 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2004.02.003)).
-  Enhanced 2SFCA (E2SFCA): 2SFCA but with less weight to providers that are still within the travel threshold but at larger distances from the point of origin ([Luo and Qi 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2009.06.002)).
- Three-Stage FCA (3SFCA): adds distance-based allocation function to E2SFCA ([Wan, Zou, and Sternberg, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2011.624987)).
- Rational Agent Access Model (RAAM) ([Saxon and Snow 2019](https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1629870)).
- Access Score: This is a weighted sum of access components like distance to provider and relative importance of provider type (Isard 1960).

The package is implemented as a single class with a number of helper functions.  According to PySAL tradition, we have also developed a broad set of [tutorials and examples](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html).


### Enhancements to Existing Packages

#### [`pysal/esda`](https://pysal.org/esda)

 - Highly performant multi-core, numba-based conditional permutation inference for local autocorrelation statistics  (#116)
  - Adbscan:  an extension of the original DBSCAN algorithm that creates an ensemble of solutions generated by running DBSCAN on a random subset and "extending" the solution to the rest of the sample through nearest-neighbor regression (see [Arribas-Bel, Garcia-Lopez & Viladecans-Marsal, 2020 for more details)](https://github.com/darribas/adbscan_buildings). (#120)

#### [`pysal/spaghetti`](https://pysal.org/spaghetti)

- Improved support for [native PySAL geometry objects](https://pysal.org/libpysal/generated/libpysal.cg.Chain.html#libpysal.cg.Chain)
- Longest and largest network component [identification](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.Network.html#spaghetti.Network.identify_components)
- Minimum/maximum [spanning trees](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.spanning_tree.html#spaghetti.spanning_tree)
- Network component [extraction](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.extract_component.html#spaghetti.extract_component)
- Refactored [*K* function](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.Network.html#spaghetti.Network.GlobalAutoK)
- [Regular lattice](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.regular_lattice.html#spaghetti.regular_lattice) generator
- [Shortest path creation](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.Network.html#spaghetti.Network.shortest_paths) and [extraction](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.element_as_gdf.html#spaghetti-element-as-gdf)
- [Testing](https://github.com/pysal/spaghetti/blob/master/.github/workflows/unittests.yml) improvements — Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- [Tutorial](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/tutorials.html) improvements and additions

#### [`pysal/mapclassify`](https://pysal.org/mapclassify)
- [Toplogical coloring](https://pysal.org/mapclassify/notebooks/05_Greedy_coloring.html) to ensure no two adjacent polygons share the same color.
- [Pooled classification](https://pysal.org/mapclassify/notebooks/04_pooled.html) allows for the use of the same class intervals across maps.

#### [`pysal/spreg`](https://pysal.org/spreg)

- New documentation [website](https://spreg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### [`pysal/libpysal`](https://pysal.org/libpysal)

#### [`pysal/giddy`](https://pysal.org/giddy)

- Testing improvements: [GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Continuous+Integration%22) — Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 on Linux, macOS, and Windows

#### [`pysal/splot`](https://splot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

- [`splot 1.1.3`](https://github.com/pysal/splot/pull/103) was published as [`Lumnitz et al., (2020). splot - visual analytics for spatial statistics. Journal of Open Source Software, 5(47), 1882, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01882`](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01882) featuring functionality, implementation and it's roadmap forward.

# PySAL 2.2.0, 2020-01-31

PySAL 2.2.0 represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test coverage, and improved documentation. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new features (see below) that have been implemented.

## Major Highlights of PySAL 2.2.0

### Meta-package looses some serious weight
PySAL is no longer a source release meta-package, but instead specifies the packages in the PySAL ecosystem as dependencies. This means that installing the `pysal` meta-package will ensure that all the subpackages are installed.

### Entirely New Packages

In this release, the PySAL family has expanded to include:

- `tobler`  **Areal interpolation and dasymetric mapping**.

### Enhancements to Existing Packages

* Refactoring of [pysal/libpysal](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal) to use remote example data sets which reduces the footprint of the source install from 25mb to under 3mb. Remote examples can now be examined with interactive maps if being run in Jupyter Notebookss.
* [pysal/mapclassify](https://github.com/pysal/mapclassify): Choropleth legend formatting has been enhanced to permit more granular control of legends.
* others here
* and here
* and here


## Changes by Package

Overall, there were 646 commits that closed 163 issues, together with 105 pull requests since our last release on 2019-07-29.

# PySAL 2.1.0, 2019-07-29

PySAL 2.1.0 represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test coverage, and improved documentation. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new features (see below) that have been implemented.

From this version forward, PySAL supports Python 3 only and is tested on Python 3.6 and 3.7. Please make sure that you are operating in a Python 3 environment.

## Major Highlights of PySAL 2.1.0

### Entirely New Packages
This release we have added the following new package(s) to the PySAL stack:

- `segregation`. **Segregation Analytics with PySAL**.

This is an extensive package that deals with segregation measurements with several frameworks ranging from inference, decomposition, street network based measures, and a multiscalar segregation profiles on urban street networks. With a consistent and well defined api following the pep8 standards, users of `segregation` (v1.1.1) can:

Calculate over 40 segregation measures from simple to state-of-the art, including:

- [aspatial segregation indices](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/aspatial_examples.ipynb)
- spatial segregation indices
  - [using spatial weights matrices, euclidian distances, or topological relationships](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/spatial_examples.ipynb)
  - [using street network distances](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/network_measures.ipynb)
  - [using multiscalar definitions](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/multiscalar_segregation_profiles.ipynb)
- [local segregation indices](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/local_measures_example.ipynb)

Test whether segregation estimates are statistically significant:

- [single value inference](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/inference_wrappers_example.ipynb)
- [comparative inference](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/inference_wrappers_example.ipynb)

[Decompose](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/decomposition_wrapper_example.ipynb)
segregation comparisons into

- differences arising from spatial structure 
- differences arising from demographic structure  


### Significant Enhancements to Existing Packages

* Addition of two rank-based Markov methods to [pysal/giddy](https://github.com/pysal/giddy): Full Rank Markov and Geographic Rank Markov, both of which avoid the potentially arbitrary selection of the discretization scheme when a discrete Markov chain is applied to continuous variables (e.g. incomes). An example notebook applying these two methods to reveal interesting spatiotemporal patterns of income distribution dynamics in the United States 1929-2009 is given [here](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/notebooks/Rank_Markov.ipynb).
* A new function [fdr](https://github.com/pysal/esda/blob/master/esda/util.py#L4) in [pysal/esda](https://github.com/pysal/esda) which account for multiple testing in local statistics by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The function takes the p-values for all of n local statistics and the significance level as the inputs, and returns the p-value cutoff which would be used for deciding whether to reject the null for each local test.
* The S-MAUP test was added to `esda`. This test statistic measures the sensitivity of statistical results to re-aggregation. Contributed by Juan Carlos Duque (@JuancaDuque), the statistic is defined in this [PLOS paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207377).
* The Lee & Local Lee statistics were added to `esda`. These statistics characterize the structure of local autocorrelation using Pearson's *r*. The statistic is defined in [Lee (2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s101090100064).
* The [`notebooks`](http://pysal.org/notebooks/intro) project, which provides a centralised online site with example notebooks from all the federated packages has undergone several back-end improvements and (partially) supports now interactive notebooks through Binder. The project is available at [http://pysal.org/notebooks](http://pysal.org/notebooks/)
* Computational improvements to `mgwr` package includes memory optimization and parallelization. The update allows GWR and Multi-scale GWR model to be calibrated faster and on much larger datasets. Additionally, there are API changes to the kernel functions in `mgwr`. [(#55)](https://github.com/pysal/mgwr/pull/55)

## Major Changes
This release, we've had a ton of activity in PySAL, much of which has been conducted in our *subpackages*, the independently-released components of our library. Because it is too onerous to list all the changes to the API here, please consult the [Migrating to PySAL 2.0](http://pysal.org/about.html#migrating-to-pysal-2-0) page for a detailed discussion of all reorganization-related changes. This document will focus *only* on improvements to functionality, enhancements, and additional modules added to `2.0`, over and above the last stable release of the `1.0` series, PySAL `1.14.4`. 


<a name="entirely-new-packages"></a>
### Entirely New Packages
For starters, we've added some entirely-new subpackages to this release candidate:

- `mgwr`, **the multi-scale Geographically-weighted regression package for Python.** 
    
    Don't worry, `mgwr` fits single-scale geographically-weighted regressions, too. Geographically-weighted regression is a kind of generalized additive model that uses kernel functions in the geographic area around each observation to predict outcomes at that area more accuratly, kind of like Gaussian Process regression for geographic data. 
- `spvcm`, for spatially-correlated multilevel models. 

    Spatially-correlated multilevel models are models that allow for random effects of nearby areas, regions, or groups to be correlated with one another. This is a Gibbs sampling framework plus diagnostics & plotting tools for general Bayesian analysis of Gibbs samplers. The package also contains simple tools to implement new samplers on top of the infrastructure provided, which is fast, parallel, serializable, iterative-write, and interruptible. 
- `spint`, for estimating spatial interaction models, such as the production-constrained or consumption-constrained gravity models. 
- `spglm`, a package for fitting sparse GLMs, focused on performance over sparse categorical data. 
- `splot`, for spatial vizualization in Python, built on top of the excellent [`geopandas`](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas). This is headed by our Google Summer of Code (2018) student, [Stefanie Lumnitz](https://github.com/slumnitz), and will be ongoing throughout the release candidate maturation cycle. 
- `pointpats`, a package for the statistical analysis of point patterns, geographical colocation, and dispersion.

<a name="significant-enhancements-to-existing-packages"></a>
### Significant Enhancements to Existing Packages

We've also had a ton of activity adding new features in our *submodules*:
- [alpha shapes](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/cg/alpha_shapes.py), a fast implementation (numba-enabled) of the [original algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1056714) generalizing convex hulls to allow for non-convex hulls
- [Contiguity weights from voronoi tesselations/delaunay triangulation graphs](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/contiguity.py#L318) for point patterns
- [Fuzzy contiguity weights](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/util.py#L1328), for polygonal data where planarity is not strictly enforced (provided in part by [`geopandas`](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas))
- A family of spatially explicit indicators of mobility association including the [inter- and intra-regional indicators](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/rank.py#L798) as well as the [local indicators](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/rank.py#L493). The inter- and intra-regional indicators provide a meso-level view on the exchange mobility pattern, shedding light on specific regions hosting frequent rank exchanges while the local indicators examine the concordance relationship between a focal spatial unit and its neighbors for revealing the role of space in shaping the exchange mobility pattern over time.
- [Categorical Spatial Markov](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/markov.py#L200), a generalization of the Spatial_Markov class previously implemented to interrogate the role of space in shaping regional income distribution dynamics to incorporate direct variables. Here, the [categorical spatial lag](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/spatial_lag.py#L90) is adopted for formalizing the neighborhood.
- [Connected Components checks](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/2843eeaaff4efa0b1816077d9e76d15ccbd81929/libpysal/weights/weights.py#L340) for our spatial graph matrices
- [Pandas Adjacency list constructors](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/2843eeaaff4efa0b1816077d9e76d15ccbd81929/libpysal/weights/weights.py#L200) and [NetworkX adapters](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/2843eeaaff4efa0b1816077d9e76d15ccbd81929/libpysal/weights/weights.py#L265) for PySAL graph objects
- [Attach islands](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/util.py#L1280), tooling to merge isolated observations into existing spatial graphs
- [Construct Contiguity graphs from linestrings](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/ea2d44da797659904000e20ddbb0f3d52efd1ad2/libpysal/weights/tests/test_contiguity.py#L110), allowing for easy and fast access to road network data in PySAL

# PySAL 1.5.0, 2013-01-31

2013-01-29 20:36  phil.stphns

	* doc/source/users/installation.txt: updating and simplifying user
	  install instructions.

2013-01-18 16:17  sjsrey

	* Adding regime classes for all GM methods and OLS available in
	  pysal.spreg, i.e. OLS, TSLS, spatial lag models, spatial error models
	  and SARAR models. All tests and heteroskedasticity
	  corrections/estimators currently available in pysal.spreg apply to
	  regime models (e.g. White, HAC and KP-HET). With the regimes, it is
	  possible to estimate models that have:
	  -- Common or regime-specific error variance;
	  -- Common or regime-specific coefficients for all variables or for a
	  selection of variables;
	  -- Common or regime-specific constant term;
	  - Various refactoring to streamline code base and improve long term
	    maintainability
	    - Contributions from Luc Anselin, Pedro Amaral, Daniel Arribas-Bel
	      and David Folch

2013-01-18 14:08  schmidtc

	* pysal/contrib/shapely_ext.py: adding unary_union() to shapely
	  contrib; note this only works with shapely version 1.2.16 or higher


2012-11-29 13:39  dreamessence 

	* pysal/contrib/viz/mapping.py: Added option in setup_ax to pass
	  pre-existing axes object to append.  It is optional and it enables,
	  for instance, to embed several different maps in one single figure

2012-11-20 00:23  dfolch

	* pysal/contrib/shapely_ext.py: adding shapely's cascaded_union
	  function to contrib

	* pysal/contrib/viz/mapping.py: -Adding transCRS method to convert
	  points from one prj to another arbitrary one -Adding map_poly_shp to
	  be able to plot shapefiles in arbitrary projections, not needing to
	  be in lonlat and not depending on Basemap

2012-11-09 15:40  sjsrey@gmail.com

	* pysal/weights/weights.py:
	  - distinguish between intrinsic symmetry and general symmetry
	
2012-11-02 17:48  schmidtc

	* pysal/weights/user.py, pysal/weights/util.py: Adding Minkowski
	  p-norm to min_threshold_dist_from_shapefile, see issue #221

2012-10-19 22:35  sjsrey@gmail.com

	* pysal/weights/weights.py:
	  explicitly prohibit chaining of transformations - all
	  transformations are only applied to the original weights at
	  instantiation

2012-10-19 17:38  sjsrey@gmail.com

	* pysal/spatial_dynamics/markov.py:
	  - fixing bug in permutation matrix to reorder kronecker product in
	    the join test

2012-10-17 17:55  sjsrey@gmail.com

	* pysal/weights/util.py:
	  -
	  higher order contiguity for WSP objects

2012-10-17 15:43  sjsrey@gmail.com

	* pysal/weights/user.py:

	  id_order attribute was always NONE for wsp created from
	  
	  queen/rook_from_shapefile with sparse=True

2012-10-16 19:25  schmidtc

	* pysal/weights/util.py: improving memory usage of
	  get_points_array_from_shapefile, no need to read entire shapefile
	  into memory.

2012-10-15 00:44  dreamessence

	* pysal/contrib/viz/mapping.py: First attempt to refactor Serge's code
	  for choropleth mapping.  It now offers a more general and flexible
	  architecture.  Still lots of work and extensions left.  The module
	  is explained in a notebook available as a gist at
	  https://gist.github.com/3890284 and viewable at
	  http://nbviewer.ipython.org/3890284/

2012-10-12 18:34  schmidtc

	* pysal/contrib/spatialnet/spatialnet.py: modified SpatialNetwork.snap
	  to calculate and return the snapped point

2012-10-12 17:05  dfolch

	* pysal/contrib/viz/mapping.py: made edits to unique_values_map to
	  allow for unlimited number of categories; I commented out the
	  previous code so these changes can easily be rolled back if it
	  breaks something somewhere else

2012-10-12 15:03  schmidtc

	* pysal/cg/segmentLocator.py: Fixing issue with segmentLocator, when
	  query point is extreamly far from the grid boundary, overflow errors
	  were causing the KDTree to not return any results.  Changed both
	  KDtree's to use Float64 and share the same data.  Previously,
	  cKDTree was using float64 and KDtree was using int32.

2012-10-11 08:12  dreamessence

2013-01-29 20:36  phil.stphns

	* doc/source/users/installation.txt: updating and simplifying user
	  install instructions.

2013-01-18 16:17  sjsrey

	* Adding regime classes for all GM methods and OLS available in
	  pysal.spreg, i.e. OLS, TSLS, spatial lag models, spatial error models
	  and SARAR models. All tests and heteroskedasticity
	  corrections/estimators currently available in pysal.spreg apply to
	  regime models (e.g. White, HAC and KP-HET). With the regimes, it is
	  possible to estimate models that have:
	  -- Common or regime-specific error variance;
	  -- Common or regime-specific coefficients for all variables or for a
	  selection of variables;
	  -- Common or regime-specific constant term;
	  - Various refactoring to streamline code base and improve long term
	    maintainability
	    - Contributions from Luc Anselin, Pedro Amaral, Daniel Arribas-Bel
	      and David Folch

	* pysal/contrib/viz/mapping.py: made edits to unique_values_map to
	  allow for unlimited number of categories; I commented out the
	  previous code so these changes can easily be rolled back if it
	  breaks something somewhere else

2012-10-12 15:03  schmidtc

	* pysal/cg/segmentLocator.py: Fixing issue with segmentLocator, when
	  query point is extreamly far from the grid boundary, overflow errors
	  were causing the KDTree to not return any results.  Changed both
