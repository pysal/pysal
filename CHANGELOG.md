v<2.3.0>, 2020-07-30

PySAL 2.3.0 represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test coverage, and improved documentation. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new features (see below) that have been implemented.

Overall, there were 1343 commits that closed 273 issues, together with 166 pull requests since our last release on 2020-02-09.



## Major Highlights of PySAL 2.3.0



### Entirely New Packages

In this release, the PySAL family has expanded to include:
#### [`pysal/access`](https://pysal.org/esda)
Providing  **classical and novel measures of spatial accessibility to services**.

- We implement classic [spatial access models](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/access.access.html#access.access), allowing easy comparison of methodologies and assumptions.
- We support spatial access research by providing pre-computed [travel time matrices](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html) and share code for computing new matrices at scale.
- We also developed a simple [web app](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/app.html) that runs the package on Amazon Web Services, allowing users to explore results without installing the package.  We think this is a fun new strategy for trying new analysis methods, and hope that it will make the package more accessible to professionals.


This access models implemented  include:

- Floating Catchment Areas (FCA): For each provider, this is the ratio of providers to clients within a given travel time to the provider ([Huff 1963](https://doi.org/10.2307/3144521), [Joseph and Bantock 1982](https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(82)90428-), and [Luo 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1353-8292(02)00067-9)).
- Two-Stage FCAs (2SFCA): Calculated in two steps for a given travel time to the provider: 1) for each provider, the provider-to-client ratio is generated, 2) for each point of origin, these ratios are then summed ([Luo and Wang 2002](https://doi.org/10.1068/b29120), and [Wang and Luo 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2004.02.003)).
-  Enhanced 2SFCA (E2SFCA): 2SFCA but with less weight to providers that are still within the travel threshold but at larger distances from the point of origin ([Luo and Qi 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2009.06.002)).
- Three-Stage FCA (3SFCA): adds distance-based allocation function to E2SFCA ([Wan, Zou, and Sternberg, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2011.624987)).
- Rational Agent Access Model (RAAM) ([Saxon and Snow 2019](https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1629870)).
- Access Score: This is a weighted sum of access components like distance to provider and relative importance of provider type (Isard 1960).

The package is implemented as a single class with a number of helper functions.  According to PySAL tradition, we have also developed a broad set of [tutorials and examples](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html).


### Enhancements to Existing Packages

#### [`pysal/esda`](https://pysal.org/esda)

 - Highly performant multi-core, numba-based conditional permutation inference for local autocorrelation statistics  (#116)
  - Adbscan:  an extension of the original DBSCAN algorithm that creates an ensemble of solutions generated by running DBSCAN on a random subset and "extending" the solution to the rest of the sample through nearest-neighbor regression (see [Arribas-Bel, Garcia-Lopez & Viladecans-Marsal, 2020 for more details)](https://github.com/darribas/adbscan_buildings). (#120)

#### [`pysal/spaghetti`](https://pysal.org/spaghetti)

- Improved support for [native PySAL geometry objects](https://pysal.org/libpysal/generated/libpysal.cg.Chain.html#libpysal.cg.Chain)
- Longest and largest network component [identification](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.Network.html#spaghetti.Network.identify_components)
- Minimum/maximum [spanning trees](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.spanning_tree.html#spaghetti.spanning_tree)
- Network component [extraction](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.extract_component.html#spaghetti.extract_component)
- Refactored [*K* function](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.Network.html#spaghetti.Network.GlobalAutoK)
- [Regular lattice](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.regular_lattice.html#spaghetti.regular_lattice) generator
- [Shortest path creation](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.Network.html#spaghetti.Network.shortest_paths) and [extraction](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/generated/spaghetti.element_as_gdf.html#spaghetti-element-as-gdf)
- [Testing](https://github.com/pysal/spaghetti/blob/master/.github/workflows/unittests.yml) improvements — Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- [Tutorial](https://pysal.org/spaghetti/tutorials.html) improvements and additions

#### [`pysal/mapclassify`](https://pysal.org/mapclassify)
- [Toplogical coloring](https://pysal.org/mapclassify/notebooks/05_Greedy_coloring.html) to ensure no two adjacent polygons share the same color.
- [Pooled classification](https://pysal.org/mapclassify/notebooks/04_pooled.html) allows for the use of the same class intervals across maps.

#### [`pysal/spreg`](https://pysal.org/spreg)

- New documentation [website](https://spreg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### [`pysal/libpysal`](https://pysal.org/libpysal)

#### [`pysal/giddy`](https://pysal.org/giddy)

- Testing improvements: [GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Continuous+Integration%22) — Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 on Linux, macOS, and Windows

#### [`pysal/splot`](https://splot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

- [`splot 1.1.3`](https://github.com/pysal/splot/pull/103) was published as [`Lumnitz et al., (2020). splot - visual analytics for spatial statistics. Journal of Open Source Software, 5(47), 1882, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01882`](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01882) featuring functionality, implementation and it's roadmap forward.

v<2.2.0>, 2020-01-31

PySAL 2.2.0represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test coverage, and improved documentation. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new features (see below) that have been implemented.

## Major Highlights of PySAL 2.2.0

### Meta-package looses some serious weight
PySAL is no longer a source release meta-package, but instead specifies the packages in the PySAL ecosystem as dependencies. This means that installing the `pysal` meta-package will ensure that all the subpackages are installed.

### Entirely New Packages

In this release, the PySAL family has expanded to include:

- `tobler`  **Areal interpolation and dasymetric mapping**.

### Enhancements to Existing Packages

* Refactoring of [pysal/libpysal](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal) to use remote example data sets which reduces the footprint of the source install from 25mb to under 3mb. Remote examples can now be examined with interactive maps if being run in Jupyter Notebookss.
* [pysal/mapclassify](https://github.com/pysal/mapclassify): Choropleth legend formatting has been enhanced to permit more granular control of legends.
* others here
* and here
* and here


## Changes by Package

Overall, there were 646 commits that closed 163 issues, together with 105 pull requests since our last release on 2019-07-29.

v<2.1.0>, 2019-07-29

PySAL 2.1.0 represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test coverage, and improved documentation. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new features (see below) that have been implemented.

From this version forward, PySAL supports Python 3 only and is tested on Python 3.6 and 3.7. Please make sure that you are operating in a Python 3 environment.

## Major Highlights of PySAL 2.1.0

### Entirely New Packages
This release we have added the following new package(s) to the PySAL stack:

- `segregation`. **Segregation Analytics with PySAL**.

This is an extensive package that deals with segregation measurements with several frameworks ranging from inference, decomposition, street network based measures, and a multiscalar segregation profiles on urban street networks. With a consistent and well defined api following the pep8 standards, users of `segregation` (v1.1.1) can:

Calculate over 40 segregation measures from simple to state-of-the art, including:

- [aspatial segregation indices](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/aspatial_examples.ipynb)
- spatial segregation indices
  - [using spatial weights matrices, euclidian distances, or topological relationships](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/spatial_examples.ipynb)
  - [using street network distances](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/network_measures.ipynb)
  - [using multiscalar definitions](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/multiscalar_segregation_profiles.ipynb)
- [local segregation indices](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/local_measures_example.ipynb)

Test whether segregation estimates are statistically significant:

- [single value inference](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/inference_wrappers_example.ipynb)
- [comparative inference](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/inference_wrappers_example.ipynb)

[Decompose](https://github.com/pysal/segregation/blob/master/notebooks/decomposition_wrapper_example.ipynb)
segregation comparisons into

- differences arising from spatial structure 
- differences arising from demographic structure  


### Significant Enhancements to Existing Packages

* Addition of two rank-based Markov methods to [pysal/giddy](https://github.com/pysal/giddy): Full Rank Markov and Geographic Rank Markov, both of which avoid the potentially arbitrary selection of the discretization scheme when a discrete Markov chain is applied to continuous variables (e.g. incomes). An example notebook applying these two methods to reveal interesting spatiotemporal patterns of income distribution dynamics in the United States 1929-2009 is given [here](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/notebooks/Rank_Markov.ipynb).
* A new function [fdr](https://github.com/pysal/esda/blob/master/esda/util.py#L4) in [pysal/esda](https://github.com/pysal/esda) which account for multiple testing in local statistics by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The function takes the p-values for all of n local statistics and the significance level as the inputs, and returns the p-value cutoff which would be used for deciding whether to reject the null for each local test.
* The S-MAUP test was added to `esda`. This test statistic measures the sensitivity of statistical results to re-aggregation. Contributed by Juan Carlos Duque (@JuancaDuque), the statistic is defined in this [PLOS paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207377).
* The Lee & Local Lee statistics were added to `esda`. These statistics characterize the structure of local autocorrelation using Pearson's *r*. The statistic is defined in [Lee (2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s101090100064).
* The [`notebooks`](http://pysal.org/notebooks/intro) project, which provides a centralised online site with example notebooks from all the federated packages has undergone several back-end improvements and (partially) supports now interactive notebooks through Binder. The project is available at [http://pysal.org/notebooks](http://pysal.org/notebooks/)
* Computational improvements to `mgwr` package includes memory optimization and parallelization. The update allows GWR and Multi-scale GWR model to be calibrated faster and on much larger datasets. Additionally, there are API changes to the kernel functions in `mgwr`. [(#55)](https://github.com/pysal/mgwr/pull/55)

## Major Changes
This release, we've had a ton of activity in PySAL, much of which has been conducted in our *subpackages*, the independently-released components of our library. Because it is too onerous to list all the changes to the API here, please consult the [Migrating to PySAL 2.0](http://pysal.org/about.html#migrating-to-pysal-2-0) page for a detailed discussion of all reorganization-related changes. This document will focus *only* on improvements to functionality, enhancements, and additional modules added to `2.0`, over and above the last stable release of the `1.0` series, PySAL `1.14.4`. 


<a name="entirely-new-packages"></a>
### Entirely New Packages
For starters, we've added some entirely-new subpackages to this release candidate:

- `mgwr`, **the multi-scale Geographically-weighted regression package for Python.** 
    
    Don't worry, `mgwr` fits single-scale geographically-weighted regressions, too. Geographically-weighted regression is a kind of generalized additive model that uses kernel functions in the geographic area around each observation to predict outcomes at that area more accuratly, kind of like Gaussian Process regression for geographic data. 
- `spvcm`, for spatially-correlated multilevel models. 

    Spatially-correlated multilevel models are models that allow for random effects of nearby areas, regions, or groups to be correlated with one another. This is a Gibbs sampling framework plus diagnostics & plotting tools for general Bayesian analysis of Gibbs samplers. The package also contains simple tools to implement new samplers on top of the infrastructure provided, which is fast, parallel, serializable, iterative-write, and interruptible. 
- `spint`, for estimating spatial interaction models, such as the production-constrained or consumption-constrained gravity models. 
- `spglm`, a package for fitting sparse GLMs, focused on performance over sparse categorical data. 
- `splot`, for spatial vizualization in Python, built on top of the excellent [`geopandas`](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas). This is headed by our Google Summer of Code (2018) student, [Stefanie Lumnitz](https://github.com/slumnitz), and will be ongoing throughout the release candidate maturation cycle. 
- `pointpats`, a package for the statistical analysis of point patterns, geographical colocation, and dispersion.

<a name="significant-enhancements-to-existing-packages"></a>
### Significant Enhancements to Existing Packages

We've also had a ton of activity adding new features in our *submodules*:
- [alpha shapes](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/cg/alpha_shapes.py), a fast implementation (numba-enabled) of the [original algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1056714) generalizing convex hulls to allow for non-convex hulls
- [Contiguity weights from voronoi tesselations/delaunay triangulation graphs](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/contiguity.py#L318) for point patterns
- [Fuzzy contiguity weights](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/util.py#L1328), for polygonal data where planarity is not strictly enforced (provided in part by [`geopandas`](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas))
- A family of spatially explicit indicators of mobility association including the [inter- and intra-regional indicators](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/rank.py#L798) as well as the [local indicators](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/rank.py#L493). The inter- and intra-regional indicators provide a meso-level view on the exchange mobility pattern, shedding light on specific regions hosting frequent rank exchanges while the local indicators examine the concordance relationship between a focal spatial unit and its neighbors for revealing the role of space in shaping the exchange mobility pattern over time.
- [Categorical Spatial Markov](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/markov.py#L200), a generalization of the Spatial_Markov class previously implemented to interrogate the role of space in shaping regional income distribution dynamics to incorporate direct variables. Here, the [categorical spatial lag](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/spatial_lag.py#L90) is adopted for formalizing the neighborhood.
- [Connected Components checks](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/2843eeaaff4efa0b1816077d9e76d15ccbd81929/libpysal/weights/weights.py#L340) for our spatial graph matrices
- [Pandas Adjacency list constructors](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/2843eeaaff4efa0b1816077d9e76d15ccbd81929/libpysal/weights/weights.py#L200) and [NetworkX adapters](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/2843eeaaff4efa0b1816077d9e76d15ccbd81929/libpysal/weights/weights.py#L265) for PySAL graph objects
- [Attach islands](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/util.py#L1280), tooling to merge isolated observations into existing spatial graphs
- [Construct Contiguity graphs from linestrings](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/ea2d44da797659904000e20ddbb0f3d52efd1ad2/libpysal/weights/tests/test_contiguity.py#L110), allowing for easy and fast access to road network data in PySAL

	* doc/source/users/installation.txt: updating and simplifying user
	  install instructions.

2013-01-18 16:17  sjsrey

	* Adding regime classes for all GM methods and OLS available in
	  pysal.spreg, i.e. OLS, TSLS, spatial lag models, spatial error models
	  and SARAR models. All tests and heteroskedasticity
	  corrections/estimators currently available in pysal.spreg apply to
	  regime models (e.g. White, HAC and KP-HET). With the regimes, it is
	  possible to estimate models that have:
	  -- Common or regime-specific error variance;
	  -- Common or regime-specific coefficients for all variables or for a
	  selection of variables;
	  -- Common or regime-specific constant term;
	  - Various refactoring to streamline code base and improve long term
	    maintainability
	    - Contributions from Luc Anselin, Pedro Amaral, Daniel Arribas-Bel
	      and David Folch

	  https://gist.github.com/3890284 and viewable at
	  http://nbviewer.ipython.org/3890284/

	  cKDTree was using float64 and KDtree was using int32.

2013-01-29 20:36  phil.stphns

	* doc/source/users/installation.txt: updating and simplifying user
	  install instructions.

2013-01-18 16:17  sjsrey

	* Adding regime classes for all GM methods and OLS available in
	  pysal.spreg, i.e. OLS, TSLS, spatial lag models, spatial error models
	  and SARAR models. All tests and heteroskedasticity
	  corrections/estimators currently available in pysal.spreg apply to
	  regime models (e.g. White, HAC and KP-HET). With the regimes, it is
	  possible to estimate models that have:
	  -- Common or regime-specific error variance;
	  -- Common or regime-specific coefficients for all variables or for a
	  selection of variables;
	  -- Common or regime-specific constant term;
	  - Various refactoring to streamline code base and improve long term
	    maintainability
	    - Contributions from Luc Anselin, Pedro Amaral, Daniel Arribas-Bel
	      and David Folch

2012-10-12 17:05  dfolch

	* pysal/contrib/viz/mapping.py: made edits to unique_values_map to
	  allow for unlimited number of categories; I commented out the
	  previous code so these changes can easily be rolled back if it
	  breaks something somewhere else

2012-10-12 15:03  schmidtc

	* pysal/cg/segmentLocator.py: Fixing issue with segmentLocator, when
	  query point is extreamly far from the grid boundary, overflow errors
	  were causing the KDTree to not return any results.  Changed both
	  KDtree's to use Float64 and share the same data.  Previously,
	  cKDTree was using float64 and KDtree was using int32.
