PySAL is an open source cross-platform library of spatial analysis functions
written in Python. It is intended to support the development of high level
applications for spatial analysis.

This is the last version in the `1.*` series. Please consult `migrating.pysal.org <https://migrating.pysal.org>`__ for an explanation of the new `2.0` series.
