Open Source Development
-----------------------

PySAL is an open source project and we invite any interested user who wants to
contribute to the project to contact one of the
`team members <https://github.com/pysal?tab=members>`_. For users who
are new to open source development you may want to consult the following
documents for background information:

-----------------------
Governance
-----------------------

PySAL is organized around the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) model of project management.
The BDFL is responsible for overall project management and direction. Developers have a critical role in shaping that
direction. Specific roles and rights are as follows:

=========   ================        ===================================================
Title       Role                    Rights
=========   ================        ===================================================
BDFL        Project Director        Commit, Voting, Veto, Developer Approval/Management
Developer   Development             Commit, Voting
=========   ================        ===================================================

-----------------------
Voting and PEPs
-----------------------

During the initial phase of a release cycle, new functionality for PySAL should be described in a PySAL Enhancment
Proposal (PEP). These should follow the
`standard format  <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0009/>`_
used by the Python project. For PySAL, the PEP process is as follows

#. Developer prepares a plain text PEP following the guidelines

#. Developer sends PEP to the BDFL

#. Developer posts PEP to the PEP index

#. All developers consider the PEP and vote

#. PEPs receiving a majority approval become priorities for the release cycle
