Tag 
---

With version 1.10 we changed the way the tags are created to reflect our
policy_ of not pushing directly to upstream.

After you have issued a pull request, the project maintainer can `create the release`_ on GitHub. 


Make docs
---------

As of version 1.6, docs are automatically compiled and hosted_.

Make and Upload and Test Distributions
--------------------------------------

On each build machine, clone and checkout the newly created tag (assuming that
is `v1.10` in what follows)::

  $ git clone http://github.com/pysal/pysal.git
  $ cd pysal
  $ git fetch --tags
  $ git checkout v1.10

- Make and upload_ to the **Testing** Python Package Index::

  $ python setup.py sdist upload -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi

- Test that your package can install correctly::

  $ pip install --extra-index-url https://testpypi.python.org/pypi pysal


If all is good, proceed, otherwise fix, and repeat.
