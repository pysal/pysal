    Example
    -------

    Setup imports and a 25x25 spatial weights matrix on a 5x5 square region.

    >>> import pysal.lib.api as lps
    >>> w = lps.lat2W(5, 5)

    Test removing various areas from a subset of the region's areas.  In the
    first case the subset is defined as observations 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The
    test shows that observations 0, 1, 2 and 3 remain connected even if
    observation 4 is removed.
