        Notes

        Based on [Rey2011]_ .

        Examples
        --------
        Constructing data for illustration of directional LISA analytics.
        Data is for the 48 lower US states over the period 1969-2009 and
        includes per capita income normalized to the national average.

        Load comma delimited data file in and convert to a numpy array

        >>> import pysal.lib
        >>> f=open(pysal.lib.examples.get_path("spi_download.csv"),'r')
        >>> lines=f.readlines()
        >>> f.close()
        >>> lines=[line.strip().split(",") for line in lines]
        >>> names=[line[2] for line in lines[1:-5]]
        >>> data=np.array([map(int,line[3:]) for line in lines[1:-5]])

        Bottom of the file has regional data which we don't need for this
        example so we will subset only those records that match a state name

        >>> sids=range(60)
        >>> out=['"United States 3/"',
        ...      '"Alaska 3/"',
        ...      '"District of Columbia"',
        ...      '"Hawaii 3/"',
        ...      '"New England"',
        ...      '"Mideast"',
        ...      '"Great Lakes"',
        ...      '"Plains"',
        ...      '"Southeast"',
        ...      '"Southwest"',
        ...      '"Rocky Mountain"',
        ...      '"Far West 3/"']
        >>> snames=[name for name in names if name not in out]
        >>> sids=[names.index(name) for name in snames]
        >>> states=data[sids,:]
        >>> us=data[0]
        >>> years=np.arange(1969,2009)

        Now we convert state incomes to express them relative to the national
        average

        >>> rel=states/(us*1.)

        Create our contiguity matrix from an external GAL file and row
        standardize the resulting weights

        >>> gal=pysal.lib.open(pysal.lib.examples.get_path('states48.gal'))
        >>> w=gal.read()
        >>> w.transform='r'

        Take the first and last year of our income data as the interval to do
        the directional directional analysis

        >>> Y=rel[:,[0,-1]]

        Set the random seed generator which is used in the permutation based
        inference for the rose diagram so that we can replicate our example
        results

        >>> np.random.seed(100)

        Call the rose function to construct the directional histogram for the
        dynamic LISA statistics. We will use four circular sectors for our
        histogram

        >>> r4=Rose(Y,w,k=4)

        What are the cut-offs for our histogram - in radians

        >>> r4.cuts
        array([ 0.        ,  1.57079633,  3.14159265,  4.71238898,  6.28318531])

        How many vectors fell in each sector

        >>> r4.counts
        array([32,  5,  9,  2])

        We can test whether these counts are different than what would be
        expected if there was no association between the movement of the focal
        unit and its spatial lag.

        To do so we call the `permute` method of the object

        >>> r4.permute()

        and then inspect the `p` attibute:

        >>> r4.p
        array([ 0.04,  0.  ,  0.02,  0.  ])

        Repeat the exercise but now for 8 rather than 4 sectors

        >>> r8 = Rose(Y, w, k=8)
        >>> r8.counts
        array([19, 13,  3,  2,  7,  2,  1,  1])
        >>> r8.permute()
        >>> r8.p
        array([ 0.86,  0.08,  0.16,  0.  ,  0.02,  0.2 ,  0.56,  0.  ])

        The default is a two-sided alternative. There is an option for a
        directional alternative reflecting positive co-movement of the focal
        series with its spatial lag. In this case the number of vectors in
        quadrants I and III should be much larger than expected, while the
        counts of vectors falling in quadrants II and IV should be much lower
        than expected.

        >>> r8.permute(alternative='positive')
        >>> r8.p
        array([ 0.51,  0.04,  0.28,  0.02,  0.01,  0.14,  0.57,  0.03])

        Finally, there is a second directional alternative for examining the
        hypothesis that the focal unit and its lag move in opposite directions.

        >>> r8.permute(alternative='negative')
        >>> r8.p
        array([ 0.69,  0.99,  0.92,  1.  ,  1.  ,  0.97,  0.74,  1.  ])
