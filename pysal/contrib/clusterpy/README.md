# PySAL Contrib Module for clusterPy

**Author: Serge Rey <sjsrey@gmail.com>**


[clusterPy][cp] is a library of spatially constrained clustering algorithms.  This contrib module provides an interface to the family of spatially constrained clustering algorithms offered by clusterPy. It also extends a select set of clusterPy classes to leverage optimized data structures in PySAL, and it provides utility functions that support use of clusterPy functionality with other PySAL modules.
