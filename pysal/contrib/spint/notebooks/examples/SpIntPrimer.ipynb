    "Spatial interaction modeling involves the analysis of flows from an origin to a destination either over physical space (i.e., migration) or through abstract space (i.e., telecommunication). Despite being a fundamental technique to many geogaphic disciplines, there is relatively little software available to carry out spatial interaction modeling and the analysis of flow data. Therefore, the purpose of this primer is to provide an overview of the recently develped spatial interaction modeling (SpInt) module of the python spatial analysis library (PySAL). First, the current framework of the module will be highlighted. Next, the main functionality of the module will be illustrated with a common regional science example, migration flows, with a dataset previously used for spatial interaction modeling tutorials in the R programming environment. Finally, some auxilliary functionality and future additions are discussed. "

Of note is that the unconstrained model with of power function distance-decay is equivalent to the basic gravity model in equation (2), except that the scaling factor, $k$, is not included. In fact, there is no scaling factor in any of the members of the family of maximum entropy models because there is a total trip constrained implied in their derivation and subsequently incorporated into their calibration (Fotheringham & O'Kelly , 1989). Another aside is that in the doubly-constrained maximum entoropy model the values for $A_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ are dependent upon each other and may need to be computed iteratively depending on calibration technqiue. It is also usually assumed that $n=m$ for doubly-constrained models.\n",

    "The family provides different model strucutre depedning on the available data or the research question at hand. The so-called unconstrained model does not conserve the total inflows or outflows during parameter estimation. The production-constrained and attraction-constrained models conserve either the number of total inflows or outflows, respectively, and are therefore useful for building models that allocate flows either to a set of origins or to a set of destinations. Finally, the doubly-constrained model conserves both the inflows and the outflows at each location during model calibration. The quantity of explanatory information provided by each model is given by the number of parameters it provides. As such, the unconstrained model provides the most information, followed by the two singly-constrained models, with the doubly-constrained model providing the least information. Conversely, the model's predictive power increases with higher quantities of built-in information (i.e. total in or out-flows) so that the doubly-constrained model usually provides the most accurate predictions, followed by the two singly-constrained models, and the unconstrained model supplying the weakest predictions (Fotheringham & O'Kelly, 1989).

Given the flexibility and extendability of a regression framework it was chosen as the primary model calibration technqiue within the SpInt module.

Using fixed effects within Poisson regression to calibrate the doubly-constrained model also avoids the need for iterative computation of the balancing factors that exists in other calibration methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration of Poisson regression can be carried out within a generalized linear modeling framework (GLM) using iteratively weighted least sqaures (IWSL), which converges to the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameter estimates (Nelder & Wedderburn, 1972). To maintain computational efficiency with increasingly larger spatial interaction datasets, SpInt is built upon a custom GLM/IWLS routine that leverages sparse data structures for the production-constrained, attraction-constrained, and doubly-constrained models. As the number of locations in these models increases, so the does the number of binary indicator variables needed to construct the fixed effects that enforce the constraints. Therefore, larger spatial interaction datasets become increasingly sparse and the utilization of sparse data structures take advantage of this feature. As a metric, constrained models with $n = 3,000$ locations, which implies $n^2 = 9,000,000$ observations can still be calibrated within minutes on a standard macbook pro notebook.  "

    "The first parameter is always the overall intercept with the subsequent 8 parameters representing the fixed effects in this case. You might ask, \"why not 9 fixed effects for the 9 different municipalities?\". Due to the coding scheme used in SpInt, and many popular statistical programming languages, you would use $n - 1$ binary indicator variables in the design matrix to include the fixed effects for all 9 municipalities in the model. While the non-zero entries in these columns of the design matrix indicate which rows are associated with which miunicipality, where a row has all zero entries then implicitly refers to the $n$th municipality that has been left out. In Spint this is always the first origin or destination for the production-constrained and attraction-constrained models. For the doubly-cosntrained model, both the first origin and the first destination are left out (Tiefelsdorf & Boots, 1995). In terms of interpetting the parameters, these dropped locations are assumed to be 0. Since the fixed effects parameters are interpretted as deviations from the overall intercept. This essentially means the intercept acts as the fixed effect for the first location. Therefore, we could also say first 9 parameters are the origin fixed effect parameters while the last two parameters are for destination attractiveness and distance, respectively. "

That is, the weakest model fit is consistently related to the gravity model, with similarly increased model fit for the production-constrained and attraction-constrained models, and finally, the best model fit is associated with the doubly constrained model. We can also see that the $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ are very close, since these models have a very similar number of explanatory variables, thereby resulting in little to no penalization for model complexity.\n",
