    "Spatial interaction modeling involves the analysis of flows from an origin to a destination, either over physical space (i.e., migration) or through abstract space (i.e., telecommunication). Despite being a fundamental technique to many geogaphic disciplines, there is relatively little software available to carry out spatial interaction modeling and the analysis of flow data. Therefore, the purpose of this primer is to provide an overview of the recently develped spatial interaction modeling (SpInt) module of the python spatial analysis library (PySAL). First, the current framework of the module will be highlighted. Next, the main functionality of the module will be illustrated using migration flows with a dataset previously used for spatial interaction modeling tutorials in the R programming environment. Finally, some future additions are discussed. "

Of note is that the unconstrained model with a power function distance-decay is equivalent to the basic gravity model in equation (2), except that the scaling factor, $k$, is not included. In fact, there is no scaling factor in any of the members of the family of maximum entropy models because there is a total trip constrained implied in their derivation and subsequently their calibration (Fotheringham & O'Kelly , 1989). Another aside is that in the doubly-constrained maximum entoropy model, the values for $A_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ are dependent upon each other and may need to be computed iteratively depending on calibration technqiue. It is also usually assumed that all locations are both origins and destinations (i.e., $n=m$) for doubly-constrained models.\n",

    "Each member of the family of models provides a different system strucutre , which can be chosen depedning on the available data or the specific research question at hand. The so-called unconstrained model does not conserve the total inflows or outflows during parameter estimation. The production-constrained and attraction-constrained models conserve either the number of total inflows or outflows, respectively, and are therefore useful for building models that allocate flows either to a set of origins or to a set of destinations. Finally, the doubly-constrained model conserves both the inflows and the outflows at each location during model calibration. The quantity of explanatory information provided by each model is given by the number of parameters it provides. As such, the unconstrained model provides the most information, followed by the two singly-constrained models, with the doubly-constrained model providing the least information. Conversely, the model's predictive power increases with higher quantities of built-in information (i.e. total in or out-flows) so that the doubly-constrained model usually provides the most accurate predictions, followed by the two singly-constrained models, and the unconstrained model supplying the weakest predictions (Fotheringham & O'Kelly, 1989).

The only practical difference here is that the distance is logged in equation (8a) whereas in equation (8b) it is not. Constrained spatial interaction models can be achieved by including fixed effects for the origins (production-constrained), fixed effects for the destinations (attraction-constrained) or both (doubly-constrained).

Similar to equation (8b) the exponential function distance-decay can be specified in equation (9b, 10-12) by ommiting the logarithm associated with $d_{ij}$. Using Poisson regression is more representative of flows and satisfies limaitations (1-2) and it also alleviates limiations (3-4) since we no longer need to take the logarithm of $T_{ij}$. Using fixed effects within Poisson regression to calibrate the doubly-constrained model also avoids the need for iterative computation of the balancing factors that exists in other calibration methods (Fotheringham & O'Kelly, 1989).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration of Poisson regression can be carried out within a generalized linear modeling framework (GLM) using iteratively weighted least sqaures (IWSL), which converges to the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameter estimates (Nelder & Wedderburn, 1972). To maintain computational efficiency with increasingly larger spatial interaction datasets, SpInt is built upon a custom GLM/IWLS routine that leverages sparse data structures for the production-constrained, attraction-constrained, and doubly-constrained models. As the number of locations in these models increases, so the does the number of binary indicator variables needed to construct the fixed effects that enforce the constraints. Therefore, larger spatial interaction datasets become increasingly sparse and the utilization of sparse data structures take advantage of this feature. As a metric, constrained models with $n = m =  3,000$ locations, which implies $n*m = n^2 = 9,000,000$ observed flows when each location is an origin and destination, can be calibrated within minutes on a standard macbook pro notebook.

For the log-normal regression specifcation, it is popular to utilize the coefficient of determination ($R^2$), though this statistic is not available within the GLM framework used by SpInt.

Like the $R^2$ statistic, the pseudo version is at a maximum at a value of 1 with higher values denoting better model fit. To acocunt for model complexity, there is also an adjusted version of this statistic,\n",

Henceforth, these psuedo $R^2$ statistics are reffered to soley as $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$.  Another model fit statistic available in the SpInt module that also acocunts for model complexity is the the Akaike information criterion (AIC),\n",

In this case we use the total out-flow and total in-flow as variables to describe how emissive an origin is and how attractive a destination is.

In fact, they can be $n^2 \\times k$ where $k$ is the number of variables that are either being used to describe origin or desitnation attributes associated with flows. It should also be noted that intra-zonal flows have been excluded (the first line of code above). This is sometimes done becasue intra-zonal flows are large compared to inter-zonal flows and would therefore heavily influence the model or becasue it is not possible to adequately define a distance associated with intra-zonal flows. Some solutions to these issues have been proposed (Kordi et al., 2012; Tsutsumi & Tamesue, 2012), though for simplicity, intra-zonal were removed for this example. Therefore "

    "The first parameter is always the overall intercept with the subsequent 8 parameters representing the fixed effects in this case. You might ask, \"why not 9 fixed effects for the 9 different municipalities?\". Due to the coding scheme used in SpInt, and many popular statistical programming languages, you would use $n - 1$ binary indicator variables in the design matrix to include the fixed effects for all 9 municipalities in the model. While the non-zero entries in these columns of the design matrix indicate which rows are associated with which miunicipality, where a row has all zero entries then implicitly refers to the $n$th municipality that has been left out. In Spint, this is always the first origin or destination for the production-constrained and attraction-constrained models. For the doubly-cosntrained model, both the first origin and the first destination are left out (Tiefelsdorf & Boots, 1995). In terms of interpetting the parameters, these dropped locations are assumed to be 0. Since the fixed effects parameters are interpretted as deviations from the overall intercept, this essentially means the intercept acts as the fixed effect for the first origin and/or destination, depending on which constrained model is calibrated. Said differently, the fixed effect for the first origin and/or destination serves as the overall intercept. "

    "First, it will be demonstrated how to interpret the coefficients associated with the main model variables from a general Poisson regression. However, becasue the spatial interaction model is a log-linear Poisson regression (i.e., we take the log of the explanatory variables) the same interpetation often cannot be applied because we are working in logarithmic space. Therefore, it will also be demonstrated how to interpret the parameters when they are associated with a logged explanatory variable.\n",

    "Recall from the previous section that the exponential distance-decay specification results in a model that does not take the logarithm of $d_ij$. Therefore, we can use an unconstrained gravity model with an exponential distance-decay specification to demonstrate a typical interpetation of coefficients from a Poisson regression."

    "-6.22938370e-03 is the coefficient for the distance variable in the above example. In Poisson regression, the coefficients are typically interpretted as the proportionate change in the predicted response, here $T_{ij}$, if we increase an explanatory variable by 1 unit (Cameron & Trivedi, 2013). Technically, this is expressed as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{T}_{ij} = T_{ij}* \\exp(\\beta) \\quad (19)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tilde{T}_{ij}$ is the new value of $T_{ij}$ and $\\beta$ is a coefficient, here the one typically associated with distance in a Poisson log-linear spatial interaction model with an exponential function distance-decay. For this example, this means from a 1 unit increase in distance, if our model predicted 2,500 flows, then we can expect the number of flows to decrease to approximately 2,484.475. We can also identify the percent change expected from a one unit increase in distance using,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta_{\\%} = (1-exp(\\beta))*100.0 \\quad (20)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which serves as an alternative interpreation of $\\beta$. In this case, we could say that from a 1 unit increase in distance we could expect the number of predicted flows to decrease by approximately 0.621%. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, neither equation (19) or (20) is applicable when the coefficient is associated with a logged explanatory variable. This is important for Poisson log-linear spatial interaction models because this applies to the origin and destination variables when using an exponential function of distance-decay and to the origin, destination, and distance variables when using a power function of distance-decay. In these cases, the interpration of the coefficients becomes the percent change in the predicted response, here $T_{ij}$, if we increase the associated explanatory variable by 1% (Cameron & Trivedi, 2013). For example, 8.91445153e-01 is the coefficient asosciated with destination total in-flows (i.e., attractiveness) in the above example. Then if we increase the in-flows to location $j$ by 1%, say from $25,000$ to $25,250$, we can expect the number of flows from $i$ to $j$ (i.e., $T_{ij}$) to increase from $2,000$ to $2,020$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the fixed effects in the constrained models can be interpretted such that the mean predicted flows, $T_{ij}$, are $e^{\\mu_{i}}$ ($e^{\\alpha_{j}}$) times larger if they originate (terminate) from location $i$ (location $j$) (Cameron & Trivedi, 2013), where $e^{\\mu_{i}}$ is equivalent notation for $\\exp(\\mu_{i})$.

    "In addition to all of the feature presented here, there are several other tools that exist in SpInt or could be added. First, there are dispersion tests avaialbe in the **dispersion** namespace of the SpInt module, which can be used to test whether or not the Poisson equidispersion asusmpotion is met. That is, that the conditional mean and variance are equivalent, which can be unrealistic in many scenarios. If these tests indicate overdispersion or underdispersion, then it might be appropriate to use a Quasi-Poisson model, which relaxes the equidispersion assumption of the Poisson model. The resulting parameter estimates are equivalent to the Poisson model, but the standard errors are typically larger whenever equidispersion does not hold (Wedderburn, 1974). The Quasi-Poisson model specification can be carried out by setting **Quasi=True** in and of the spatial interaction model classes. Alternatively, it might be more appropriate to change the underlying probability model from Poisson to that of negatibe binomial or a zero-inflated model. However, this has not yet been implemented in SpInt and therefore remains as future work.\n",

    "Another area of potential expansion is accommodate several paradigms for incorporating spatial effects into spatial interaction models, such as competing destinations (Fotheringham, 1983),  a spatial lag autoregressive model (LeSage & Pace, 2008), or an eigenvector spatial filter model (Chun, 2009). These paradigms require code that computes additional variables, complex calibration techniques, and specialized representations of spatial relationships. While some solutions to the later are available in the **spintW** namespace of the **weights** module of PySAL, there is still much work to be done to develop a more robust set of spatial interaction modeling tools.
