    Classic Theil measure of inequality

            T = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \\frac{y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i} \ln \left[ N \\frac{y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}\\right] \\right)

    Parameters
    ----------
    y   : array (n,t) or (n,)
          with n taken as the observations across which inequality is
          calculated.  If y is (n,) then a scalar inequality value is
          determined. If y is (n,t) then an array of inequality values are
          determined, one value for each column in y.

    Attributes
    ----------

    T   : array (t,) or (1,)
          Theil's T for each column of y

    Notes
    -----
    This computation involves natural logs. To prevent ln[0] from occurring, a
    small value is added to each element of y before beginning the computation.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> f=pysal.open(pysal.examples.get_path("mexico.csv"))
    >>> vnames=["pcgdp%d"%dec for dec in range(1940,2010,10)]
