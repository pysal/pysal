                  Function must take a single scalar as input and return a

    Test the hypothesis that var[y] = mu (equidispersion) against the

    alt_var() specifies an alternative variance as a function of mu.
    alt_var=lambda x:x corresponds to an alternative hypothesis of a negative
    binomimal model with a linear variance function and alt_var=lambda
    x:x**2 correspinds to an alternative hypothesis of a negative binomial
