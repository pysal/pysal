    -------
    wc      : pysal.W, scipy.sparse.csr.csr_matrix
              Clipped W object (sparse if outSP=Ture). It inherits
              ``id_order`` from w1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pysal as ps

    First create a W object from a lattice using queen contiguity and
    row-standardize it (note that these weights will stay when we clip the
    object, but they will not neccesarily represent a row-standardization
    anymore):

    >>> w1 = ps.lat2W(3, 2, rook=False)
    >>> w1.transform = 'R'

    We will clip that geography assuming observations 0, 2, 3 and 4 belong to
    one group and 1, 5 belong to another group and we don't want both groups
    to interact with each other in our weights (i.e. w_ij = 0 if i and j in
    different groups). For that, we use the following method:

    >>> w2 = ps.regime_weights(['r1', 'r2', 'r1', 'r1', 'r1', 'r2'])

    To illustrate that w2 will only be considered as binary even when the
    object passed is not, we can row-standardize it

    >>> w2.transform = 'R'

    The clipped object ``wc`` will contain only the spatial queen
    relationships that occur within one group ('r1' or 'r2') but will have
    gotten rid of those that happen across groups

    >>> wcs = ps.weights.Wsets.w_clip(w1, w2, outSP=True)

    This will create a sparse object (recommended when n is large).

    >>> wcs.sparse.toarray()
    array([[ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.33333333,  0.33333333,  0.        ,
             0.        ],
           [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,
             0.        ],
           [ 0.2       ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  0.2       ,  0.2       ,
             0.        ],
           [ 0.2       ,  0.        ,  0.2       ,  0.        ,  0.2       ,

             0.        ]])

    If we wanted an original W object, we can control that with the argument
    ``outSP``:

    >>> wc = ps.weights.Wsets.w_clip(w1, w2, outSP=False)
    WARNING: there are 2 disconnected observations
