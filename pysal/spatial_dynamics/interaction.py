    Method for reformatting event data stored in a shapefile for use in
    calculating metrics of spatio-temporal interaction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path            : string
                      the path to the appropriate shapefile, including the
                      file name, but excluding the extension
    time            : string
                      column header in the DBF file indicating the column
                      containing the time stamp
    infer_timestamp : boolean
                      if the column containing the timestamp is formatted as
                      calendar dates, try to coerce them into Python datetime
                      objects

    Attributes
    ----------
    n               : int
                      number of events
    x               : array
                      n x 1 array of the x coordinates for the events
    y               : array
                      n x 1 array of the y coordinates for the events
    t               : array
                      n x 1 array of the temporal coordinates for the events
    space           : array
                      n x 2 array of the spatial coordinates (x,y) for the
                      events
    time            : array
                      n x 2 array of the temporal coordinates (t,1) for the
                      events, the second column is a vector of ones

    Examples
    --------

    Read in the example shapefile data, ensuring to omit the file
    extension. In order to successfully create the event data the .dbf file
    associated with the shapefile should have a column of values that are a
    timestamp for the events. This timestamp may be a numerical value
    or a date. Date inference was added in version 1.6.

    >>> path = pysal.examples.get_path("burkitt")

    Create an instance of SpaceTimeEvents from a shapefile, where the
    temporal information is stored in a column named "T".

    >>> events = SpaceTimeEvents(path,'T')

    See how many events are in the instance.

    >>> events.n
    188

    Check the spatial coordinates of the first event.

    >>> events.space[0]
    array([ 300.,  302.])

    Check the time of the first event.

    >>> events.t[0]
    array([ 413.])

    Calculate the time difference between the first two events.

    >>> events.t[1] - events.t[0]
    array([ 59.])

    New, in 1.6, date support:

    Now, create an instance of SpaceTimeEvents from a shapefile, where the
    temporal information is stored in a column named "DATE".

    >>> events = SpaceTimeEvents(path,'DATE')

    See how many events are in the instance.

    >>> events.n
    188

    Check the spatial coordinates of the first event.

    >>> events.space[0]
    array([ 300.,  302.])

    Check the time of the first event. Note that this value is equivalent to
    413 days after January 1, 1900.

    >>> events.t[0][0]
    datetime.date(1901, 2, 16)

    following example runs the standardized Mantel test without a constant

    should be added by the user. This can be done by adjusting the constant
    and power parameters.
