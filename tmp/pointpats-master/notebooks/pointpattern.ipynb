    "We introduce basic terminology here and point the interested reader to more [detailed references](#References) on the underlying theory of the statistical analysis of point patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points and Event Points\n",
    "\n",
    "To start we consider a series of *point locations*, $(s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n)$ in a study region $\\Re$. We limit our focus here to a two-dimensional space so that $s_j = (x_j, y_j)$ is the spatial coordinate pair for point location $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be interested in two different types of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Event Points\n",
    "\n",
    "*Event Points* are locations where something of interest has occurred. The term *event* is very general here and could be used to represent a wide variety of phenomena. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to recognize that in the statistical analysis of point patterns the interest extends beyond the observed point pattern at hand.\n",
    "The observed patterns are viewed as realizations from some underlying spatial stochastic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arbitrary Points\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of point we consider are those locations where the phenomena  of interest has not been observed. These go by various names such as \"empty space\" or \"regular\" points, and at first glance might seem less interesting to a spatial analayst. However, these types of points play a central role in a class of point pattern methods that we explore below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point Pattern Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of event points focuses on a number of different characteristics of the collective spatial pattern that is observed. Often the pattern is jugded against the hypothesis of complete spatial randomness (CSR). That is, one assumes that the point events arise independently of one another and with constant probability across $\\Re$, loosely speaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, many of the empirical point patterns we encounter do not appear to be generated from such a simple stochastic process. The depatures from CSR can be due to two types of effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First order effects\n",
    "\n",
    "For a point process, the first-order properties pertain to the intensity of the process across space. Whether and how the intensity of the point pattern varies within our study region are questions that assume center stage. Such variation in the itensity of the pattern of, say, addresses of individuals with a certain type of non-infectious disease may reflect the underlying population density. In other words, although the point pattern of disease cases may display variation in intensity in our study region, and thus violate the constant probability of an event condition, that spatial drift in the pattern intensity could be driven by an underlying covariate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second order effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The second channel by which departures from CSR can arise is through interaction and dependence between events in space. The canonical example being contagious diseases whereby the presence of an infected individual increases the probability of subsequent additional cases nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When a pattern departs from expectation under CSR, this is suggestive that the underlying process may have some spatial structure that merits further investigation. Thus methods for detection of deviations from CSR and testing for alternative processes have given rise to a large literature in point pattern statistics."
