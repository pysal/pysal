PySAL is an open source
cross-platform library for geospatial data science with an emphasis on
geospatial vector data written in Python. It supports the development of
high level applications for spatial analysis, such as

-   detection of spatial clusters, hot-spots, and outliers
-   construction of graphs from spatial data
-   spatial regression and statistical modeling on geographically
    embedded networks
-   spatial econometrics
-   exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis

PySAL Components
================

-   **explore** - modules to conduct exploratory analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data, including statistical testing on points, networks, and
    polygonal lattices.  Also includes methods for spatial inequality,  distributional dynamics, and segregation.
-   **viz** - visualize patterns in spatial data to detect clusters,
    outliers, and hot-spots.
-   **model** - model spatial relationships in data with a variety of
    linear, generalized-linear, generalized-additive, and nonlinear
    models.
-   **lib** - solve a wide variety of computational geometry problems:

    -   graph construction from polygonal lattices, lines, and points.
    -   construction and interactive editing of spatial weights matrices
        & graphs
    -   computation of alpha shapes, spatial indices, and
        spatial-topological relationships
    -   reading and writing of sparse graph data, as well as pure python
        readers of spatial vector data.

***********
Development
***********

As of version 2.0.0, PySAL is now a collection of affiliated geographic
data science packages. Changes to the code for any of the subpackages
should be directed at the respective `upstream repositories <https://github.com/pysal/help>`_ and not made
here. Infrastructural changes for the meta-package, like those for
tooling, building the package, and code standards, will be considered.


PySAL development is hosted on github_.

Discussions of development occurs on the
`developer list <http://groups.google.com/group/pysal-dev>`_
as well as gitter_.
