PySAL is an open source library of routines for exploratory spatial data
analysis using Python.  It is a community project sponsored by the GeoDa
Center for Geospatial Analysis and Computation at Arizona State University.
PySAL originated with code contributions by Luc Anselin and Serge Rey.

Since then many people have contributed to PySAL, in code development,
suggestions, and financial support.  Below is a partial list.  If you've
